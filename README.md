# Detection of Electric Vehicles and Solar Systems in Smart Meter Data

This GitHub repository is part of a paper submission to the MDPI Journal Energies

In the course of the switch to renewable energy sources, there is a shift from a few large energy sources (power plants) to a large number of small, distributed energy sources (e.g. solar systems) and energy storage devices (e.g. electric vehicles). This results in the need to know and identify these energy sources and sinks as soon as new devices are installed in order to ensure grid stability. This paper presents an approach to identify energy sources and energy storage in smart meter data, using solar systems and electric vehicles as examples. For this purpose, the Pecan Street dataset is used, which has been extended by charging processes from the ACN dataset. The presented approach comprises a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network and an Multilayer Perceptron, which decides separately on the basis of smart meter data of a household whether an electric vehicle and a solar system are present. It is shown that the combination of both classifiers achieves an accuracy of 90.50 % in the case of electric vehicle detection and 96.37 % in the case of solar systems. It is also shown that the power levels lower than 0 kW in the case of the solar system and higher than 5 kW in the case of the electric vehicles have the largest influence on the output of the Multilayer Perceptron branch, which uses the power balance distribution as input.
